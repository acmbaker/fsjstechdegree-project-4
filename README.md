# Full Stack JavaScript Project 4

For this project, I created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."

## The Brief
You’ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

Using JavaScript, you’ll create two JavaScript classes with specific properties and methods. You'll create a Game class for managing the game, and a Phrase class to help with creating an array of Phrase objects.

Your code will choose a random phrase, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the gameboard.

Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.

## Exceeds Expectations Requirements
Add keyboard functionality - the user can type using their keyboard which will work the exact same way as clicking one of the keys.

I have made various styling changes to the page, including replacing the heart image with a red coloured one, changing the background colours and more.

## Outcome
Everything is functioning as per the brief and exceeded grade requirements.
